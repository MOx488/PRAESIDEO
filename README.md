# PRAESIDEO

## Description
PRAESIDEO is a multiplayer strategy game inspired by Stellaris in a medieval setting.

When joining or creating a game, you can build your own empire including traits, which you can see on the map as soon as the game starts.
You have a starting castle that produces resources for you.
You can also explore, colonize, upgrade and develop other castles to produce more resources and build buildings and new districts to extend your castle.
All improvements and buildings take time to build and there can only be one of these tasks at a single castle at a time.
You can trade resources at the market, research enhancements and experience various in-game events.
